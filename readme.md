## music-eq 

This is a simple Python script that let anyone play doing some live coding to make music. This was inspired by the live coding performance GEDE2 by [Gabriel](https://github.com/gabochi/rampcode), where he created amazing music doing digital synthesis improvisation generated by functions that take time as the only input variable.

### Usage

To launch it just execute the script in a Python console:
```
python3 music-eq.py
```

To create sounds just write a formula where `t` will be the current time in the execution (exclusively dependent of time) and copy it to the clipboard (ctrl+c). Each time you copy something executable in the clipboard, the equation being executed will change to that.
For example, copy the line below while running the script to play a sinewave of 1KHz:
`0.2*sin(2*pi*1000*t)`
